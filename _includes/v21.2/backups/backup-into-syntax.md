The syntax `BACKUP ... INTO` adds a backup to a [collection](take-full-and-incremental-backups.html#backup-collections) within the backup destination. The path to the backup is created using a date-based naming scheme. Versions of CockroachDB prior to v21.1 used the syntax `BACKUP ... TO` to backup directly to a specific operator-chosen destination, rather than picking a date-based path. The `BACKUP ... TO` syntax will be **deprecated** in future releases. For more information on this soon-to-be deprecated syntax, [see the docs for v20.2](../v20.2/backup.html) or earlier.
